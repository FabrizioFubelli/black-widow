# GUI

### **black-widow** provides a very modern, simple and fast graphical user interface.

Unlike most cyber security and penetration testing tools, black-widow has a pretty **Web GUI** built with [**Django**](https://www.djangoproject.com/) and served by the integrated [**Gunicorn Server**](https://gunicorn.org/).

The Django application use a [SQLight](https://sqlite.org/index.html) database to save the necessary data. That database is stored on default black-widow [storage](https://github.com/offensive-hub/black-widow/tree/master/app/storage) path.
